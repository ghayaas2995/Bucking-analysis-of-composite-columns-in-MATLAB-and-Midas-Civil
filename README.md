# Bucking-analysis-of-composite-columns-in-MATLAB-and-Midas-Civil

The CFST column is a composite materials system which employs the various
advantages of different materials and combines them together in a steel tube column with filled
concrete. Composite sections are becoming increasingly popular in construction. Combining the
strength of two different materials to form a composite section might be beneficial. Example for
widely used composite section in construction is composite slabs, which is very popular in
recent years, here concrete slabs and steel beams combine to resist load. There is a surge in
popularity of composite columns. Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) are used in many
structural applications including columns, supporting platforms of roofs of storage tanks,
offshore structures, columns in seismic zones and bridge piers.
In this study, the load carrying capacity of the composite steel columns will be validated
for Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) of different grades such as M20 M30 M40 by developing
programs using MATLAB software. The complex behavior of composite steel columns plays an
important role in the seismic design. Natural frequencies, time periods and modal frequencies are
obtained for different slenderness ratios (L/D) of steel columns varying from 15 to 156 i.e, only
short columns filled with SCC are considered for carrying this study. Diameter of column
varying from 337mm to 483mm and length from 202.2mm to 678.4mm is considered as
experimental results are available from different national and international research works
including R&D works carried out at Civil Engineering research laboratory at Ghousia College of
Engineering by previous UG, PG and research scholars since 2010 till date.
The above considered columns are also modelled in a FEM software MIDAS CIVIL
2018 for different end support conditions such as fixed and hinged. Comparative studies have
been carried out in variation of loads for the different end conditions.
